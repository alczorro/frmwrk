Service Framework
=================

This is a base module of Duckling, which provides a framework for
building RESTful services.

Add its .jar into your web applications. Maven is recommended.

Refer to the subproject 'frmwrk-test', which shows the configuration
within a webapp.

In a nutshell, configure servlets in web.xml and take care of the
config file 'Rest2Services.xml' and 'services.xml', respectively for
the new and old version. They could be used at the same time.

Good luck!
